## Some possibly useful things.
* vector lib
  * [vec](https://github.com/MichaelJWelsh/vec/blob/master/vec.h)
* map lib
  * [map](https://github.com/rxi/map)

## Things that will help out later
* Change all instances of `char* kind` and friends to Enums.
  * Parse the corpus into something meaningful.
